# Container Queries Article Card Demo
Demo of using experimental tech container-queries to build an article feed layout.

NOTE: This demo uses the syntax and features supported by Chrome Canary on 26th June 2021.
Container-queries are still under development and subject to change, thus this code might/will get outdated.
For example, to define a container this demo uses `contain: layout style inline-width`. The proposal changed the keyword to `container: size | inline-size | block-size | etc...`, but that change isnâ€™t implemented in Chrome Cannery at the time of writing of this doc. 

# Demo
