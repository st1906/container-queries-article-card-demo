        target="_blank"
      >
        Chrome Cannery</a
      >
      under the chrome://flags -> "Enable CSS Container Queries".
    </p>
    <p>
      Keep in mind that this demo uses the syntax and features the version of
      Chrome Cannery supported on 27th June 2021. Container-queries are still in
      the process of standardization and subject to changes, thus this demo
      might stop working.
